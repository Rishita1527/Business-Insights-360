🏢 Company Background
AtliQ Hardware sells computers and accessories through three main channels:
•	🏬 Retailers
•	🛒 Direct Sales

Recently, the company faced losses from a poorly planned store expansion in the USA, which was based only on surveys and Excel analysis. This experience highlighted the urgent need for a dedicated analytics system to reduce guesswork and improve business decisions.
